# PAT 甲级 1056 Mice and Rice (25 分) 

Mice and Rice is the name of a programming contest in which each programmer must write a piece of code to control the movements of a mouse in a given map. The goal of each mouse is to eat as much rice as possible in order to become a FatMouse.

First the playing order is randomly decided for NP programmers. Then every NG programmers are grouped in a match. The fattest mouse in a group wins and enters the next turn. All the losers in this turn are ranked the same. Every NG winners are then grouped in the next match until a final winner is determined.

For the sake of simplicity, assume that the weight of each mouse is fixed once the programmer submits his/her code. Given the weights of all the mice and the initial playing order, you are supposed to output the ranks for the programmers.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers: NP and NG (<= 1000), the number of programmers and the maximum number of mice in a group, respectively. If there are less than NG mice at the end of the player's list, then all the mice left will be put into the last group. The second line contains NP distinct non-negative numbers Wi (i=0,...NP-1) where each Wi is the weight of the i-th mouse respectively. The third line gives the initial playing order which is a permutation of 0,...NP-1 (assume that the programmers are numbered from 0 to NP-1). All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print the final ranks in a line. The i-th number is the rank of the i-th programmer, and all the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

Sample Input:
11 3
25 18 0 46 37 3 19 22 57 56 10
6 0 8 7 10 5 9 1 4 2 3

Sample Output:
5 5 5 2 5 5 5 3 1 3 5

#### 题意：

np为老鼠的数量，ng为每组最多g个老鼠。先给出np个老鼠的重量，再给出老鼠的初始顺序（第i名的老鼠是第j号，j从0开始）。每ng个老鼠分为一组，对于每组老鼠，选出最重的那个，晋级下一轮比赛，然后依次再以np个老鼠一组分类，然后选出重量最大的。。。直到只剩下一只老鼠，排名为1.输出为老鼠的排名，这个排名是按照原输入老鼠的顺序输出的

#### 思路：

每np个老鼠排序，直到最后只剩一只老鼠。

其实不难，只是因为看错题意而走了很多弯路，记录一下

#### 错误点：

* 首先把第三行的第i个数看成是第i个老鼠的出场顺序了，还加个一个order变量来记录；

  结果它是出场的是第i个老鼠，注意区分

* 其次，每次的失败的老鼠都是一样的排名的，我以为最后一次都会有排名

* 最后，rank数组的处理：每次老鼠的名次是**晋级的老鼠的数量+1**就行了，

  我是每次按轮次进行加减，只能知道他是第几轮淘汰的，最后还要在处理下；

#### 代码：

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
struct player{
    int id, w;
};
bool cmp(const player& a, const player& b){
    return a.w > b.w;
}
int rk[1006];
vector<player> now, temp;
int main(){
    int n, g;
    cin >> n >> g;
    now.resize(n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        scanf("%d",&now[i].w);
        now[i].id = i;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int a;
        scanf("%d",&a);
        temp.push_back(now[a]);
    }
    int cnt = 1;
    now = temp;
    while(now.size() > 1){
        temp.clear();
        auto index = now.begin();
        auto end = index + g;
        while(end < now.end()){
            sort(index, end,cmp);
            int t = index - now.begin();
            temp.push_back(now[t]);
            index = end;
            end += g;
        }
        if(index != now.end()){
            sort(index, now.end(),cmp);
            int t = index - now.begin();
            temp.push_back(now[t]);
        }
        //直接所有赋值，晋级的老鼠下次会覆盖
        for(auto x:now) rk[x.id] = temp.size() +1;
        now = temp;
    }
    rk[now[0].id] = 1;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if(i) cout<< ' ' <<rk[i];
        else cout << rk[i];
    system("pause");
}
