## 1018 [Public Bike Management](https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/994805342720868352/problems/994805489282433024)最短路径

#### 原题：

There is a public bike service in Hangzhou City which provides great convenience to the tourists from all over the world. One may rent a bike at any station and return it to any other stations in the city.

The Public Bike Management Center (PBMC) keeps monitoring the real-time capacity of all the stations. A station is said to be in perfect condition if it is exactly half-full. If a station is full or empty, PBMC will collect or send bikes to adjust the condition of that station to perfect. And more, all the stations on the way will be adjusted as well.

When a problem station is reported, PBMC will always choose the shortest path to reach that station. If there are more than one shortest path, the one that requires the least number of bikes sent from PBMC will be chosen.

Figure 1 illustrates an example. The stations are represented by vertices and the roads correspond to the edges. The number on an edge is the time taken to reach one end station from another. The number written inside a vertex S is the current number of bikes stored at S. Given that the maximum capacity of each station is 10. To solve the problem at S3, we have 2 different shortest paths:

1. PBMC -> S1 -> S3. In this case, 4 bikes must be sent from PBMC, because we can collect 1 bike from S1 and then take 5 bikes to S3, so that both stations will be in perfect conditions.

2. PBMC -> S2 -> S3. This path requires the same time as path 1, but only 3 bikes sent from PBMC and hence is the one that will be chosen.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 numbers: Cmax (<= 100), always an even number, is the maximum capacity of each station; N (<= 500), the total number of stations; Sp, the index of the problem station (the stations are numbered from 1 to N, and PBMC is represented by the vertex 0); and M, the number of roads. The second line contains N non-negative numbers Ci (i=1,...N) where each Ci is the current number of bikes at Si respectively. Then M lines follow, each contains 3 numbers: Si, Sj, and Tij which describe the time Tij taken to move betwen stations Si and Sj. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in one line. First output the number of bikes that PBMC must send. Then after one space, output the path in the format: 0->S1->...->Sp. Finally after another space, output the number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC after the condition of Sp is adjusted to perfect.

Note that if such a path is not unique, output the one that requires minimum number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC. The judge's data guarantee that such a path is unique.

Sample Input:

10 3 3 5
6 7 0
0 1 1
0 2 1
0 3 3
1 3 1
2 3 1

Sample Output:

3 0->2->3 0

#### 题目大意

每个车站的最大容量为一个偶数Cmax，如果车站中自行车的数量为Cmax/2，则认为该车站处于“完美状态”，如果有一个车站自行车数量为0或者为Cmax，则认为该车站有问题，从控制中心PBMC出发携带一定数量的自行车前往该车站，并在路上收集一些自行车，使得沿途的车站以及最终到达的问题车站达到“完美状态”，求出从PBMC到达该问题车站的最短路径，如果有多条，选择需要从PBMC携带自行车数量最少的路径；如果仍有多条，选择从问题车站带回自行车最少的。

#### 分析

利用Dijkstra算法求出所有距离最短的路径，然后再用DFS找出最短路径。只有Dijkstra是不可以的，因为minNeed和minBack在路径上的传递不满足最优子结构，不是简单的相加的过程，只有在所有路径都确定了之后才能区选择最小的need和最小的back。因此还需要DFS找出最短路径。为了编码方便，不妨在读入每个车站的自行车数量时都减去Cmax/2，如果仍为正表示该车站需要带回自行车，如果为负表示该车站需要从PBMC获取自行车。
