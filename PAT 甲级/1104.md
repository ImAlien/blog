#### 题目：

Given a sequence of positive numbers, a segment is defined to be a consecutive subsequence. For example, given the sequence {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}, we have 10 segments: (0.1) (0.1, 0.2) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.2) (0.2, 0.3) (0.2, 0.3, 0.4) (0.3) (0.3, 0.4) (0.4).

Now given a sequence, you are supposed to find the sum of all the numbers in all the segments. For the previous example, the sum of all the 10 segments is 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.9 + 0.3 + 0.7 + 0.4 = 5.0.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N, the size of the sequence which is no more than 105. The next line contains N positive numbers in the sequence, each no more than 1.0, separated by a space.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the sum of all the numbers in all the segments, accurate up to 2 decimal places.

Sample Input:
4
0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4
Sample Output:
5.00

#### 题意：

给定一个序列，求所有连续子数组的和

#### 思路：

O（n）做法：对于某一个数，包括他的子数组有（该位前面的个数（包括自己））*（该位后面的个数）个；

#### 代码：

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    long long sum = 0;
    double temp;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { 
        cin >> temp;
        sum += (long long)(temp * 1000) * i * (n - i + 1);
    }
    printf("%.2f", sum / 1000.0);
    return 0;
}
```
