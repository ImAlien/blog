# F(x)

#### 题目：

For a decimal number x with n digits (AnAn-1An-2 ... A2A1), we define its weight as 
$$
F(x) = A_n * 2^{n-1} + A_{n-1} * 2^{n-2} + ... + A_2 * 2 + A_1 * 1.
$$
Now you are given two numbers A and B, please calculate how many numbers are there between 0 and B, inclusive, whose weight is no more than F(A).
